# Visualizing Loans Awarded by Kiva

In this project I visualize insights using a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fkosmowski/kivadhsv1). The dataset contains information about loans awarded by the non-profit Kiva.

The project is part of the [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog) Data Science Career Path. There is a bit of guidance provided but a lot of the analysis is left to personal decision.

The whole analysis as well as visualisations are found in the [Jupyter Notebook](kiva_project.ipynb).
